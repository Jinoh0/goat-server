##GOAT.ASK

This is our third project , developed in the last week of the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp.

We devloped a website filled with functions that can improve the studies and code training as you go through the bootcamp just like we did! 

Before we talk about the functions of the site , i bring here the technologies and frameworks used during the development, they are : ReactJS , Javascript , Tailwind CSS , Node.js , HTML , ExpressJS , MONGODB ,Mongoose. 

Our project was came to light in the last month of the bootcamp , while talking about the memories and the experience we had during the bootcamp , and then we realized that we are not going to have a teacher or teacher assistants helping us no more , and at the same time the we felt that the teachers were having some issues when finding example kata's or exercises with difficulty according to the module we were in.

The website GOAT.ASK is the solution we came with , it is a website where you can bring your doubts about a certain subject and post on the site where other alumnis or even the teacher could get it and answer or comment some tips.

We made this site hoping that in the future the site will have a huge stack of good questions and help the new incoming Ironhackers to go through the initialization in the programming world with more ease.
